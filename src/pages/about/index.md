### Who are we?

motherufk

Big Duck is a passionate collective of music enthusiasts and gig promoters, proud to celebrate all things good about music and their live experiences! Beginning our journey in mid-2019 with Naybeats, we have since followed with a series of fully-packed gigs, featuring carefully curated lineups with artists and arrangements both unorthodox and varied. Always seeking to bring an eclectic mix of both well-loved scene veterans and fresh up-and-comers with potential; we deliver high energy and exciting shows, where every event is an unforgettable experience for our audiences (and artists as well!).

### What is This?

Over time, we felt that this passion didn’t have to be one that stopped at shows - so here at our site, we have built another space to celebrate our music in its different forms. We’ll highlight the tunes and bands our team is passionate about, talk to artists about the music that inspires them and their journeys, give our opinions on the latest releases and entertain you with our columns and everything that lay in between. We look forward to highlight all interesting music across all that genres that lay between!

### Our Aim.

Our aim, in particular, is to create a platform available for smaller, aspiring artists - whose sounds don't necessarily exist within the confines of pop contexts and conventional performances. We want Big Duck to be a space for everyone to feel comfortable in expressing themselves in any way - through dress, dance or however else they may wish!
