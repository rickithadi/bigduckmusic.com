From intriguing shakuhachi studies to gentle indie folk, Lydia Ang has been quietly releasing a steady cross-genre repertoire of tracks since 2012, blending singer-songwriter sensibilities with a penchant for the sonically experimental. Here, the calm, granular blue that tinges *Amid*’s graduated cover serves as an apt metaphor for the music it contains – within a melancholic outlook, she delivers her most sombre and consistent work with pop-tinged songwriting and sound design that would be friendly to readers of The Wire.

Here, it’s this attention to detail that helps the songs stand out. The steady 4/4 pulse of *Ghostly Grains* gives way to xx-style guitar lines and Chromatics-like deliveries that form hypnotic monotone synth-pop, while bubbling, pulsating metallic textures fill the instrumental palette of *Moth and Mayfly*. It’s when she envelops her music in this mist where the tracks become most appealing – and accordingly, *Asylum* is the album’s highlight. With pounding sub-bass frequencies moving pulsating, glacial textures, she weaves together reverberating pianos, sparse guitar lines and droning waves of glass-like synths.

Far from the vocal-heavy stylings of her past work, *Amid*’s veil of sonic obscura raises her melodies beyond singer-songwriter purgatory. Despite these songs carrying a strong interest in their microscopic details, they unfortunately feel a little too meandering at times. There is a lack of gravitas and impact when it comes to the hooks and melodic sensibilities throughout, which leads to an album that feels like it takes itself a little too seriously and perhaps is a little too self-indulgent. The later half of the album in particular suffers because of this - with its comparatively straightforward production bringing skeletal and weak songwriting to light.

Amid is a solid album in its own right, and a sure testament to Ang’s commitment to sonic exploration and pushing her artistic boundaries. Even with songwriting that might not seem to hit the mark at times, Ang’s densely layered, atmospheric production alongside a keen attention to detail create a worthwhile exploration of heartbreak and existential dread.

# RENE

#### ***"Off My Mind"***

###### Off My Mind / Where Are The Fruits?

With light innocent touches to indie-pop formulas, RENE has slowly established herself with an energetic, guitar-friendly persona over the past couple of years, emerging in events like The Great Singapore Replay and SCAPE's Music Day Out . “RENE is a pop-rock musician. Pop Punk? Punk rock? Alternative…?” her Spotify bio tells us. To “rock” kids on the block, her singles presented an undoubtedly appealing sound perfectly on trend – with her pleasant melodies and upbeat vocal deliveries allowing a buoyancy that finds kinship with other teen-friendly pop attempts on the island (see tragically: [Royal Estate](https://open.spotify.com/track/4l8xFbuOP5shyhH5b3z9e9?si=31vZPHuHQrSjN6YWJx4Ykw)). Unfortunately, with her first single, she finds herself with a case of mistaken identity. The answer definitely lies within these realms – sadly, her answer is most definitely not punk.

It’s marketable! But as the video finds RENE fronting the guerilla stage of DIY bastion Lithe House, there’s a misplaced energy that’s hard to ignore. With production so polished and neutered, the song is scrubbed devoid of any sense of rock-star energy sonically or attitude, and certainly nothing close to the indie rock guise she's trying to put on.

It’s an absolute shame, especially when considering the performance that its burying. Here, RENE’s vocals are more than competent, and she shows glimpses of strength in moments (state examples). Yet completely unlike the pomp of her heroes or what she could very well try to be (Hayley Williams, beabadoobee for a modern equivalent) she is almost completely obstructed by the track’s lifeless production – in what can only be described as neutered attempts at 1975-esque jangle.

Rather than allowing her voice to shine through playful abrasion or powerful refrains, the mix plays things absurdly safe, with drums lacking any sort of distinctive dynamics, and glass-like guitars simply gliding along without character, leading to a result that absolutely betrays the genre pools she aspires to be. Her voice almost mirrors these choices, all too often too restrained… “Punk rock” and “Alternative” leaning this is not– unless alternative means a Boyce Avenue-like takeover for the next National Day Parade theme song. Singapore would probably like that. But even so, [Electrico](https://youtu.be/qdY5k2e-7g4) has done it better.

Make no mistake – the song is dripping with nice melodies. “I can’t get seem to get you off my mind,” she yearns with classic pop harmonies, and with her pleasantly sweet delivery, the song does its best to be a breezy, feel-good pop song dedicated to die-hard past loves. But embracing pop wholesale is not a bad thing – and by doubling down on production choices that complement her stylistic preferences, her vocal presence will have more room to shine.

With the song finishing with a mild aftertaste, it’s RENE’s still many doses of grit away from touching the punk label. For now, it’s an ambiguity that struggles to linger the right way.

Pop Punk? Punk rock? Alternative…? Toned down NDP song.

# Imp Act

#### ***“The Island of Alsocanla”***

**The Island of Alsocanla**

Although a ways from their first release, local instrumental rock band Imp Act follows up with another single that would make many [65daysofstatic](https://open.spotify.com/track/1QuJm7XRpFjEfOU6A01mw2?si=yJWiHw5RRqGyo7s3V4Timg) fans bang their heads. Formed in 2019, the band consists of local veteran rockers such as Jay, who was a Berklee student, Willie from [No Duff](https://youtu.be/Lo62kURAnUw) and Benjamin formerly of [Rockweller](https://youtu.be/4WG4NLHrAgU).

Me being a huge fan of 65daysofstatic, *The Island of Alsocanla* is an instant hit for me. Firstly though, I wanna talk about the name of the song which I didn’t realize the meaning of until I was writing this review and I had to type it out. Kudos to them for the subliminal singlish messaging, although I might have ruined it!

From the beginning, the song traverses a few different time signatures before arriving at the bridge. I personally like how they don’t utilize the palm-muted triplet on the guitar for every single phrase in the measure, to keep it interesting as the song goes on.

The djent-infused tones the guitar uses is an interesting addition to their take on the instrumental rock genre but I’m not sure if I like it very much. I also think that the drums could be a little more in-your-face in the and the bass is kind of lost within the mix.

However, what really sold it for me is the section when the piano comes in as it is my favorite instrument. It is a very serene lull in the action and it is fitting for what lies ahead.

One main thing I want to shine a spotlight on is that the song does not follow a typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus outro structure, and that is what made it stand out to me. Imp Act either wants to tell a story with the song, or break away from the mold. They also have a visual artist, Qush, in the band. I hope 2021 is a good year for Singapore as I would like to watch them perform live to see what they have planned for us.
