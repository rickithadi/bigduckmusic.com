**it's 12:45, where are you?**

Wira Munir from rap collective [Hidemen](https://open.spotify.com/album/4OvuBtLRwr541XVDaBOJ8c?si=PatrYZr4SX2GrGOn63pwjQ) comes through with an emotive solo effort about unrequited love on *it’s 12:45, where are you?.* Munir wears his heart on his sleeve lyrically both in his melodious singing and competent rapping, where he longs to be the object of affection of a girl he admires. Instrumentally, the track serves the intent of the song well with its sparse keys, percussive beats, and ambient pads all setting the mood.

Munir acknowledges that he knows that he isn’t the man of choice as he sings of still being there regardless (“I’m not the one you think of, as you run your fingers down/ I know I’m not the one you’d try, but I’d pull up if you dial”) and switches it up as he raps on a verse of a fantasy in which he gets what he wants ("Just us together/ No view but the sun/ I hope you really think that’d be fun/ And we ride on our feelings/ We write down our feelings”).

*it’s 12:45, where are you?* is a track that I feel would fly by the radars of many but is still well worth a listen, in particular for how Munir paints his image of longing through his lyrics.

# Fauxe & Shye

#### ***"More"***

###### MAJULAH WEEKENDER

![More - Fauxe & Shye](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/c_scale,h_600/v1600477641/FauxeShye800_ub5rcn.jpg "More - Fauxe & Shye")

Elegant, introspective, and deceivingly minimalistic, *More* is an instance where collaboration results in something greater than the sum of its parts. As part of the National Youth Council and Zendyll Records’ [MAJULAH WEEKENDER](https://www.timeout.com/singapore/music/majulah-weekender) initiative, in which a seasoned producer is paired with a fresh voice to work together on a song, More is definitely a strong contender for being the best of the bunch.

The track’s vocal melodies and harmonies beautifully crafted by Fauxe and Shye are the main focal point here, perfectly encapsulating its themes of patience and acceptance in an oddly serene exploration of emptiness. Shye’s reserved yet unabashed sincerity shines through both in its delivery and its lyrics (“I’ve been thinking too much/ Do whatever is cool/ Always try to be you/ In everything that you do/ In everything that we do/ So strive for something”). Fauxe’s production work here epitomises the ever elusive approach of “less is more”, being seemingly understated whilst subtly retaining just enough depth that it feels like there’s something new to discover with each listen, every little sound evoking a myriad of emotions.

“I guess I’ll wait” Shye wistfully sings to the sound of soft waves crashing in the background as the song comes to a close. It’s powerfully melancholic yet still hopeful, a strong testament to how music can help express the feelings and thoughts that words just can’t.

#### ***“Neo Punggol”***

"In many ways, the album is a mighty return to form, full of blistering noise and abstract beatscapes that synthesize into a powerful statement for troubled times. On *Neo Punggol*, they come in the form of punishing, rhythmic grids – a slice of no-wave nihilism, channeled through modular synth intensity."
