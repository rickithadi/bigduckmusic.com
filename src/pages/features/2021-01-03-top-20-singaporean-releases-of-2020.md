### As we welcome a new year, we run down our personal ranking of the best Singaporean albums and EPs worth celebrating from 2020.

2020’s been a tough year, and it’s safe to say that the Singaporean music scene wasn’t spared as well. As the teeth of COVID-19 sunk in with the circuit breaker, our usual experiences with music saw the knife of disruption driven into them - tours were cancelled, campaigns were delayed, and artists lost out on opportunities to test and promote their new material on the live stage.

But it was also a year of solidarity and reinvention. As local institutions like [Lithe House](https://www.facebook.com/litheparalogue/) came to the brink of closure, the community quickly united to save it with a fundraiser. Other institutions found new life in secondary alternative ventures, from a [club-turned speakeasy bar](https://www.facebook.com/headquarters.sg/), to transformed livestream events from [Uploading](https://www.instagram.com/uploadingsg/) and [Tonehouse Studios](https://www.tonehouse.sg/). We adopted that spirit here at Big Duck too - as we await our return to the live stage, we converted our Big Duck Energy into highlighting the richness of our music scenes here and beyond at our site, joining the ranks of fellow publications [NME Asia](https://www.nme.com/en_asia/), [Singapore Community Radio](https://www.sgcommunityradio.com/), and [Life In Arpeggio](https://www.lifeinarpeggio.com/).

Of course, the driving force behind it was simple: the music stayed good. As artists hunkered down indoors with the pandemic, creativity became its saving grace, as artists in our scene found room to further refine and record with its accompanying lull. We saw fresh sounds emerge from a collective spirit of exploration. New voices in unprecedented genres emerged, while established names came back sharper. The result was a flourishing, diverse landscape of releases, one we’re proud to celebrate as we welcome a new year of musical exploration.

So to send off the disaster that was 2020, we’ll gradually be revealing our picks of last year's Singaporean albums/EPs we heard that stuck the most with us. For the sake of posterity, we’ve condensed it to 20 picks and 5 honourable mentions, but even with these rankings, all these works are equally worth celebrating. Our rankings are purely our own personal opinion: take them at most with a grain of salt. After all, there were many more wonderful works we wished we could mention – from carnatic footwork ([iyer](https://iyer.bandcamp.com/)) and modular soundscapes, ([Kin Leonn/Hiroshi Ebina](https://kitchenlabel.bandcamp.com/album/faraway-vicinity)), progressive suites ([Fauxe](https://suneyerecords.bandcamp.com/album/new-life)) and emerging indie royalty ([Shye](https://open.spotify.com/album/6sYWO4IATLL7LZtgkwm2eU?si=P4m6tngXR_CuZzClO1EjmQ) and [Kotoji](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ixPHpwO5iGcTPMlsbEBpk?si=9kIXpNXDQJ-kHSRL-R_RtQ)), to introspective ambient pop ([Lydia Ang](https://lydiaang.bandcamp.com/album/amid)) and wonderful documents of collective creativity ([Syndicate's *SEED*](https://syndicatesg.bandcamp.com/album/seed)). These don’t even include the endlessly memorable singles, which would've brought in an even more diverse cast – from adventures searching for food ([Wovensound's *Hunger Pangs*](https://open.spotify.com/album/324bGZ60PMO8pitxU8siVF?si=uotdCRIQTUi_b0kJDTyd0w)) and reinventions in glitchwork ([Anise](https://anise.bandcamp.com/track/eve)), to noise-rock freakouts ([sl_owtalk](https://sl-owtalk.bandcamp.com/track/berpecah)) and glittering hyperpop debuts ([Cayenne](https://open.spotify.com/track/7LoduJv2prGxny0GagzCdm?si=86Zui2mORVm70pCpveB6ZQ)).

Ultimately, they form a small slice of Singapore’s diverse musical offerings this year. These were some releases among many worth remembering - and in a year that felt like ten compressed into one, 2020 gave room for them all.

## TOP 20 SINGAPOREAN RELEASES OF 2020

### 20. Feston - *Field Notes*

#### Ambient

![Feston - Field Notes](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1609662728/Top%2020/hon_field_notes_v3kf8b.jpg "Feston - Field Notes")

\-

A quieter venture for Stopgap/Gouch guitar wizard Calvin Joseph Phua, the ambient music he makes as Feston makes its appeals through calm, microscopic studies. Dubbing his project as thematic music about the trauma of modernity, Field Notes takes on much more of a healing character, dissolving the tension of the drones that filled last year's frigid *[pēⁿ​-​ká](https://feston.bandcamp.com/album/pe-ka)*. Here, aural scenes from Seoul to Kathmandu intertwine with carefully crafted textures, creating their own distinct transportive worlds via a comforting naturalistic palette.

Altogether, they form aural snapshots of locales yearned to be rediscovered. On HP, wandering guitar fragments colour distant reveries, as cavernous field recordings build an enveloping urban melancholia – on others (Riverwaves), the soundscapes embrace comforts of the natural world, as radiating shimmers amalgamate with the flowing of creeks and streams. Even at the collection’s most alive, like on Kamal Marga’s ritualistic processions, they are portals to contemplative liminal spaces – as chants and percussion dissolve into fuzzy, modulating drones, its mass forms a glow of mystifying psychedelia. There’s a warm spirit that imbues itself across Field Notes’ three sketches – and for a year that has reveled in chaos, its gentle, yet explorative serenity always feels welcome.

### 19. Bongomann - *Smiles EP*

#### Deep house

\-

Bongomann’s *Smiles EP* is filled with the satisfying amalgamation of thumping kicks drums and bass grooves, upbeat open hi-hats, and chopped up vocal samples that would light up the dancefloor - a bubbling formula all perfectly packaged within a slick yet hazy atmosphere. Be it the cruising groove of collaborator Halal Sol’s “reluved” remix of *Deeperluv (Get it)* or the enticingly percussive *CHIPS,* there’s a little something for all fans of house music or anyone just looking for a good time at the club – or hopefully as the pandemic tides over, another gathering of fun at his [Ice Cream Sundays](https://www.facebook.com/icecreamsundayssg/).

### 18. BAD DOD - *Yikes!*

#### Garage rock

![Bad Dod - Yikes](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1609662727/Top%2020/18_yikes_srt46g.jpg "Bad Dod - Yikes")

\-

BAD DOD’s *Yikes!* is unadulterated, pure rock goodness. The trio’s debut album is a tight, hard-hitting love letter to its garage rock and grunge influences (Nirvana, The Vines and Jay Reatard, to name a few); chock-full of contagious energy, inspired songwriting and a healthy dose of self-awareness underneath it’s no-fucks-given exterior. Opening track *FIGHT* is a masterclass in riff rock songwriting, setting the stage for the rest of the atomic fuzz-laden, mosh-inciting runtime – while *Feel Nothing Yet* and *Outta My Brain* highlight BAD DOD’s acute pop sensibilities, with their infectious hooks sacrificing none of its pummelling drive. Above all, *Yikes!*' well-crafted songwriting stays consistent throughout the album –and at just 24 minutes, it's an exhilarating listen that never overstays its welcome. Above all, it sounds like a band just having a whole lot of fun.

### 17. per[sona - These Algorithms Don’t Work Anymore

#### Alternative/Indie rock

![persona - These Algorithms Don't Work Anymore](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1609836316/Top%2020/17_persona_vdciks.jpg "persona - These Algorithms Don't Work Anymore")

\-

Birthed from a near-death experience, per[sona is a peek into the soul of musician and producer Joshua Aaron Goh. His debut EP *These Algorithms Don’t Work Anymore* is a triumphant indie rock effort – channeling Reznor to Radiohead as he paints an earnest chronicle of his internal struggles, as he paves his way to recovery from self-defeat.

In the process, per[sona squeezes out what is easily some of the best recent work from renowned Singaporean producer Leonard Soosay. Even as lush electronic textures masterfully blend with live instrumentation and captivating vocal performances, its clean mix never lacks the urgency and edge required for when it gets going – like on rockier tracks such as *Splinters* or *Version*. The gorgeous soundscapes on Up/Away and Posthumous further build atmosphere upon the emotional quality of the tracks.

Despite the seemingly dreary and existential nature of the EP, hope remains its overarching message. In that respect, *These Algorithms Don’t Work Anymore* succeeds - being not just an exploration of the human condition, but also a strong testament to its spirit.

### 16. Houg - The Oscillation Scene

#### Chillwave

![Houg - The Oscillation Scene](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1609662727/Top%2020/16_houg_iszvad.jpg)

\-

With nostalgic aesthetics and tasteful production choices heavily indebted to 80s-adjacent sonic palettes, the excellent songwriting on Houg’s sophomore trip-hop effort The *Oscillation Scene* is anything but derivative. In equal parts groovy and introspective, the EP's dense layers never loses focus.

With driving drum machine hits, bass thumps and claps, *ICBM*'s powerful lyricism and refrains present an enticing duality, forming both commentaries on love's struggles and critiques on artistic integrity. On *Wet Wants*, a combination of tasty guitars, sax licks and understated keys set the stage for impassioned vocal performances, altogether leading to satisfyingly huge snares and infectious, grooving verses. On other notes, like on closing track *Slippin’*, Houg walks the line between his trip-hop and art rock influences, with the resulting track feeling soaring, cathartic, and profound.

Massive, yet melancholic and intimate, *The Oscillation Scene* presents an honest narrative, depicting Houg's own bouts wrestling with self-doubt and insecurity. Across its 6 tracks, the Oscillation scene feels fresh, provocative, and sensual- but most importantly, it feels honest.

## Top 15 coming soon...

## Honourable Mentions

### Hauste - *Patterns*

#### Math Rock

![Hauste - Patterns](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1609662271/Top%2020/hon_patterns_ioihdp.jpg "Hauste - Patterns")

\-

Although admittedly not as emotionally cathartic as its predecessor, the math rock trio’s follow-up effort to 2018’s excellent *[Leavings](https://haustesound.bandcamp.com/album/leavings)* still finds room for dynamic highlights. From neurotic bass theatrics in *Bassball* to breezy jams in *Happy and Angels*, they also find new diversity to their palette, courtesy of Bobbi Brown’s laid-back hip-hop bounce (*Courduroy*). Refining their formula of technicality towards more settled forms, hauste find themselves maturing with Patterns, and reaffirm themselves as one of the island’s premier math outfits.

### Everything Us Alright - *Not Really*

#### Emo / Singer-songwriter

![Everything Us Alright - Not Really](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1609662728/Top%2020/hon_everything_us_alright_i9rqrj.jpg "Everything Us Alright - Not Really")

\-

With a far starker palette than his band’s instrumental colour (recorded in fact, with just a single microphone and guitar), math rock geek and Woes bandleader Russell Seow somehow finds an even stronger emotional potency in his solo project’s Midwest-flavored emo folk. From gentle, finger-picked yearning (*The Moon,* *I Wish I Could...*) to the driving storminess of *A Haunting*, Not Really glimmers with self-reflective beauty – with gentle guitars and painfully honest vocals, a calm catharsis invites you to bleed its Owen-like heart out with him.

### BGourd/Halal Sol - *Veggie Wraps Vol.1*

#### Hip House / Boom-bap

![BGourd Halal Sol - Veggie Wraps Vol 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1609662727/Top%2020/hon_bgourd_vol1_my5bdn.jpg "BGourd Halal Sol - Veggie Wraps Vol 1")

\-

Paired with co-conspirator Halal Sol’s hip-house grooves, BGourd’s first wraps kicked the year’s doors in with unabashed joy, setting the stage for the rapper’s grandly green persona. Balancing self-aware bragaddocio (*6th Best Wrapper*) with infectious hooks, Vol. 1 served as an absurdly fun introduction to Sean Lim’s lyrically dense boom-bap flows – with Danny Brown-esque delivery, he moves from shitting gloriously on fake hypebeasts (*Waste*) to celebrating his food family (kimchi jigae and his [beansprout-gimmicked](https://www.instagram.com/limbrotherstravel/) brother all included). With all his quirks well-armed, it was a winning opening salvo for the gourd – and luckily for RT (and even better for us), this was only the beginning.

### BIND - *STATE OF MIND*

#### Hardcore

![BIND - STATE OF MIND](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1609662728/Top%2020/hon_Bind_state_of_mind_mckx3u.jpg "BIND - STATE OF MIND")

\-

Consisting of veterans across the hardcore scene, BIND’s EP *STATE OF MIND* taps into years of experience to form an impressively tight, impassioned, and heavy debut. Be it the searing refrain on *Defy Your Hate* (“I, I won't play your game! I, I defy your hate!) or the metallic riffing on *Astray*, *STATE OF MIND* possesses all the conviction needed to make an age old sound seem fresh.

### deførmed - *LATE TO THE LOUDNESS WAR*

#### Experimental Electronic

\-

With a blistering blend of industrial dance grooves, hard-hitting drum and bass beats, and hardcore punk-esque vocals over a cathartically driving noise-rock aesthetic, up-and-coming [Syndicate](https://www.syndicate.sg/) producer deformed masterfully warps colourful synths and demented samples in what sounds like a signature sound in the making.
