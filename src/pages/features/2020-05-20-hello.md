</span><a href="/artists/1311-el-p/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El-P</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has fended off easy trends while relentlessly pushing rap into the unknown. And now, at 45, after decades of squelching experimentalism, the rapper-producer is enjoying the greatest popularity of his career with&nbsp;</span><a href="/artists/31319-run-the-jewels/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run the Jewels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Brooklyn artist’s unlikely cult stardom hasn’t quelled his insurgent tendencies, though. If anything, it feels like the rap world at large has finally come around to his signature sound—a combination of hard-knocking, old-school drums and queasy synths teleported from the year 3000. But he still talks like someone who has embraced his outsider role: “I’m used to my opinion not being everyone else’s opinion,” he says with a laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born Jaime Meline, El spent most of his life as a pivotal figure in rap’s roiling underground. He was the crux of New York crew </span><a href="/artists/8777-company-flow/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company Flow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 1990s before making his way as an accomplished solo artist with albums like 2002’s </span><a href="/reviews/albums/2712-fantastic-damage/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic Damage</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 2012’s </span><a href="/reviews/albums/16641-cancer-for-cure/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer 4 Cure</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the 2000s, he ran the Definitive Jux label, releasing records from like-minded misfits including </span><a href="/artists/670-cannibal-ox/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannibal Ox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="/artists/2850-mr-lif/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Lif</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="/artists/29-aesop-rock/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aesop Rock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At nearly every turn, he has bolstered underdogs amid the big business of rap.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout 2020,&nbsp;Fat Possum Records is </span><a href="/news/el-p-finally-releasing-his-def-jux-albums-on-streaming/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reissuing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his solo catalog, a treasure trove of lopsided productions and meticulous raps teeming with visions of the apocalypse that sound as timely as ever. As he looks back, he’s also looking forward to his latest album with </span><a href="/artists/5605-killer-mike/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Killer Mike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the end of January, he stepped away from putting the finishing touches on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run the Jewels 4</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—“This should be the record that we fall off,” he says, “but I’m just feeling like that’s not going to be the case”—to tell me about his formative experiences as a listener. Speaking over the phone from New York, he sets scenes from his past as if he’s reliving them in real time.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block2" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/longform/985/NUMBERS05.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div class="text-block text-inset-image text container-fluid"><div class="inner row"><div class="contents"><div class="inset-image ">                                <img src="https://cdn4.pitchfork.com/longform/985/queen.jpg">                                       </div><h2><b><a href="/artists/12927-queen/">Queen</a>: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE" target="_blank">Another One Bites the Dust</a>”</b></h2><p>El-P: My parents loved music, and I got into a lot of stuff as a 5-year-old just because it was playing in my house—the turntable was the center of the living room at the time, and there wasn’t any cable TV. With “Another One Bites the Dust,” I remember very specifically just being like, “What the fuck is this shit? Why are my shoulders moving? This is all happening and I have no context for this as a human.” It was a brand new feeling.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids love to dance. They’re really just looking for the driving beat. And it’s funny, because there are always parents showing us videos of their kids jamming out to Run the Jewels. Our records are certainly not meant for children—they’re not PG—but kids don’t give a shit. They don’t know what the fuck is happening, they just know that this shit is fun. It puts a smile on my face. Like, “Yeah, I remember that.”</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block4" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/longform/985/NUMBERS10.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div class="text-block text-inset-image text container-fluid"><div class="inner row"><div class="contents"><div class="inset-image ">                                <img src="https://cdn4.pitchfork.com/longform/985/fletch.jpg">                                       </div><h2><b>Harold Faltermeyer: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-lu0vjHSO0" target="_blank">Fletch Theme</a>”</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was a kid, my parents would be like, “Come on, kid. We’re going to cut school and go see a movie.” And they always exposed me to stuff that wasn’t really age appropriate. I was 4 when my dad took me to see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jerk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I just cried because I felt so bad for Steve Martin’s character.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My parents had the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sMMt2M3RiU" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fletch</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> score on vinyl, and it set me on the path of seeking out music from films, which has continued through my life. Way before I got into trying to collect records for breaks, I was already collecting weird shit from film scores, because apart from the radio and my older sister Lisa playing me stuff, that was where I would hear music.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this day I feel like Harold Faltermeyer is an underrated musician—he should be as revered for his score work as John Carpenter is. He’s just so fucking incredible. There was something about the way that these cats did ’80s shit that made you feel cool, like you were the character in the movie. Like, “Yeah, maybe I’m a clever detective!” I still listen to score music that way. It’s all made to evoke a feeling. You’re always running through your own film in your head, to some degree. It had a huge influence on me.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block6" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/985/age10.jpg" alt=""><div class="caption caption--right"><span>A young El-P</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block7" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn2.pitchfork.com/longform/985/NUMBERS15.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div class="text-block text-inset-image text container-fluid"><div class="inner row"><div class="contents"><div class="inset-image ">                                <img src="https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/longform/985/epmd.jpg">                                       </div><h2><b><a href="/artists/7527-epmd/">EPMD</a>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nwd2HEFvabhnHO7x2TMheYPeyJ1wMyKAc" target="_blank"><i>Business as Usual</i></a></b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s iconic. I mean, they had four straight classic albums—that’s the Run the Jewels fantasy. That’s been our model from the very beginning. We have to try and live up to the standard that EPMD set. Me and Mike really look to them as inspiration: They’re these badass characters who are also goofy and funny and always pushing it further.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time you got an EPMD record, they just got rawer and doper. Every single song jammed on all those records, and especially this one. It had crazy shit on it like “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpSuEW2uyi0&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nwd2HEFvabhnHO7x2TMheYPeyJ1wMyKAc&amp;index=11&amp;t=0s" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rap Is Outta Control</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” which was this completely bugged-out, weird jam that is an unheralded classic. I really love those dudes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 15, I had a Tascam 4-track cassette recorder and a secondhand TR-505 drum machine—maybe the worst drum machine ever made. Even at the time I was like, “I don’t know what to do with this thing.” But I was doing a bunch of tape loop stuff. That’s how I started. I was recording demos and trying to make beats. Back in the early ’90s, every time you thought you might start to have something figured out, someone would come out with a record that would completely change production, and all of a sudden you’re like, “Fuck, I’m 100 miles away again.” You’re trying to come up with your version of it and it’s like fucking traveling to the moon, and the moon just keeps moving back. It felt insurmountable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And EPMD raised the bar. At that time, they were doing short, half-bar loops that were funky and repetitive, which definitely lent itself to the way I looked at sampling. When I finally got really into it, I leaned much less towards looping up whole four-bar sections and looked at the smaller parts of what was going on, seeing what I could pull out. That was due to EPMD.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block9" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/longform/985/NUMBERS20.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div class="text-block text-inset-image text container-fluid"><div class="inner row"><div class="contents"><div class="inset-image ">                                <img src="https://cdn4.pitchfork.com/longform/985/mobbdeep.jpg">                                       </div><h2><b><a href="/artists/4755-mobb-deep/">Mobb Deep</a>: <a href="/reviews/albums/19240-mobb-deep-the-infamous-the-infamous-mobb-deep/"><i>The Infamous</i></a></b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was 15, I shared a manager with Mobb Deep. I don’t think they stuck with him, and I definitely didn’t, but I met those dudes a couple of times. I had their original demo under the name Poetical Prophets, which got them in the Unsigned Hype column at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Source</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And I had actually submitted beats to the label for the first record they did, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lo4EnmWSRpkroprlQMIyCfj0eBWR9u1t8" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juvenile Hell</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Back then, they were on some smooth, slick shit, but I was hearing from the inside about the evolution of where they were going. Still, I had no idea that they were going to do what they did.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they dropped this record, it was just the hardest, most fucking street, most sinister, most real-sounding shit. It took everyone by legitimate surprise. It was such a fucking moment. I remember listening to </span><a href="https://stretchandbobbito.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stretch &amp; Bobbito</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hearing them play the album version of “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/yoYZf-lBF_U" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shook Ones, Pt. II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” It’s a legendary, legendary piece of music. I was blown away by it. They changed everything. They made an East Coast gangster record that wasn’t derivative of anything else.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Company Flow was well into making <i><a href="/reviews/albums/13019-funcrusher-plus/">Funcrusher</a></i></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;when they dropped it in 1995, and we considered them to be great. Whenever you make your first album, you make it strictly as a fan. And Mobb Deep were up at the top in terms of people who were dropping exciting shit. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Infamous</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also justified some of my leanings, because our shit was going to be kind of sinister, too.

I went to the HMV in fucking Piccadilly Circus and was looking for mini-disc releases that I could listen to on my player, and there really weren’t any. And then I saw </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kid A</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I knew nothing about it. I hadn’t really gotten into Radiohead yet. Honestly I just bought that shit because I was walking to some girl’s apartment and I wanted something to listen to.</span></p><p>I walked like five miles through the city, by myself, and it couldn’t have been a better day to listen to that album: gray and raining. I listened to it over and over again on this walk. I fell in love with Radiohead based off that record and that experience. On this melancholic, shitty-ass day, I was suddenly listening to this dude who’s basically saying, “Hey, it’s a melancholic, shitty-ass life.” I really felt like I got it.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block14" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/985/NUMBERS30.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div class="text-block text-inset-image text container-fluid"><div class="inner row"><div class="contents"><div class="inset-image ">                                <img src="https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/longform/985/stone.jpg">                                       </div><h2><b><a href="/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/">Queens of the Stone Age</a>: <a href="/reviews/albums/6607-lullabies-to-paralyze/"><i>Lullabies to Paralyze</i></a></b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nNB9md4acQQWlEyK0W6FZ3ODDkYkpA2S4" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Songs for the Deaf</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I was a huge Queens of the Stone Age fan. I saw the video for “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/s88r_q7oufE" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No One Knows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and was like, “Goddamn, this riff is crazy.” And then I started to listen to the lyrics and was like, “These dudes can fucking write.” I look at their run similar to the EPMD run—except their run never stopped. So buying this was automatic for me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There aren’t too many bands that I trust so much that I even distrust myself if I don’t fully love something at first, but that’s what Queens is to me. I put just them on repeat. I didn’t know exactly how to feel about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lullabies to Paralyze</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at first—it didn’t have the immediacy of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Songs for the Deaf</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which just grabbed you. This one had to unfold a little bit more, but I basically like every song that they’ve ever done.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block16" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/985/NUMBERS35.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div class="text-block text-inset-image text container-fluid"><div class="inner row"><div class="contents"><div class="inset-image ">                                <img src="https://cdn2.pitchfork.com/longform/985/grinderman.jpg">                                       </div><h2><b><a href="/artists/5203-grinderman/">Grinderman</a>: <a href="/reviews/albums/14622-grinderman-2/"><i>Grinderman 2</i></a></b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had gotten into </span><a href="/artists/710-nick-cave/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Cave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through to the score for the \[2006] film </span><a href="/reviews/albums/1373-the-proposition-ost/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Proposition</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After that, I just was randomly picking up shit that he was a part of, and that’s how I found Grinderman. This album nails that raw energy that I look for—and when I find it, I latch on to it. There’s a danger to it, and there’s an intellectualism about it that is sort of tongue-in-cheek.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not necessarily going to listen to every Nick Cave record and think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Nick Cave expressing Nick Cave’s feelings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He’s often coming up with characters, and that’s a really cool aspect of making music. I don’t think music has to always be, like, “Here’s my heart and my story,” because quite frankly that may not be that interesting all the time. It’s a good reminder to me as a writer that it’s nice to have the ability to come from a different place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2009 was the year that I spent having lost everything. Everything that I was working on and all the relationships I put my energy into creatively had just come to a Hindenburgian fucking explosion. I was broke. I had to downgrade everything. I was eating once a day. I was really humbled and terrified and I didn’t have anything going on for a minute. I was trying to pick up the pieces and figure out what my life was going to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2010, a couple things happened. First, Fat Possum came in and offered me a deal for a solo album, which would ultimately become </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer 4 Cure</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that saved my ass. I actually had a little bit of money in my pocket again, and I was starting to be like, “OK, I’m going to focus on me.” Then, all of a sudden, my friend Jay is like, “Hey, I want you to meet up with Killer Mike.” I’m like, “Don’t get your hopes up.” In that same year, I met my now wife. Both people met me when I didn’t really have shit, and that changed everything for me.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block18" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn2.pitchfork.com/longform/985/age35.jpg" alt=""><div class="caption caption--right"><span>El-P with then-girlfriend (and now-wife) Emily Panic circa 2010.</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block19" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/985/NUMBERS40.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div class="text-block text-inset-image text container-fluid"><div class="inner row"><div class="contents"><div class="inset-image ">                                <img src="https://cdn4.pitchfork.com/longform/985/asap.jpg">                                       </div><h2><b><a href="/artists/30007-asap-rocky/">A$AP Rocky</a>: <a href="/reviews/albums/20661-atlonglastaap/"><i>At.Long.Last.A$AP</i></a></b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think people gave this record the love that they should have. It’s fucked up and weird at times, but it just knocked. Like “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GYroMrmZ1U" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">M’$</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”—come on man, that’s one of the hardest records of the last 10 years! He really was saying some shit on this record.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes people just miss an artist’s progression because they have a definite idea of who that person is. Sometimes your timing is off, and by the time you want a progression from someone, you’ve ignored the fact that that actually already happened. That record was a progression for Rocky, but I don’t think people heard it that way. I really felt it was an opus. But this happens a lot. How many classic records also have a classically bad review?</span></p><p>On the one hand, it’s terrifying for an artist to put their shit out there for critical review, because you don’t want to be misunderstood, and it plays such a big part in the way people receive records. But on the other hand, seeing how this shit plays out over time, you can relax a little bit, because it doesn’t always all line up in the moment. I like the idea that people can reevaluate shit because I don’t think that records or films are 100 percent across the board meant to be digested in one sitting. They have to grow on you. If we were all quizzed about the records that we didn’t like at first but ultimately ended up liking, there would be a lot of surprising things mentioned.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block21" class="basic-image embed-width-visual container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="embed embed-width-visual--embed"><img src="https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/longform/985/NUMBERS45.jpg" alt=""></div></div></div></div><div class="block-wrapper"><div id="feat5e7b971f1f638000081a69f9-pg0-block22" class="text-block text container-fluid"><div class="inner row"><div class="contents"><h2><b><a href="/artists/31319-run-the-jewels/">Run the Jewels</a>: <i>Run the Jewels 4</i></b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My life at this stage has really all been about this record. For the last year and a half, I haven’t been doing anything else. It’s been this dream process because we treated ourselves to go to these wonderful, iconic places. We did a bunch of work at Shangri-La, working at Rick Rubin’s studio—you spend a week there and you’re just like, “Can I intern here?” We worked a bunch at Electric Lady, and then at my studio in New York.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, this shit is just hard front to back. It feels like everything me and Mike love about rap and making records. Run the Jewels has always been an homage to a degree, to a feeling that we had, to the classic groups that we came up with—not trying to recreate them, but to just live in that feeling when we’re making music. And this record, even more than the first three, really captures that. We may have fucked around and hit our EPMD guidelines. I have to apologize to everybody because I think we’re actually going to fucking stick around for a while.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><a class="end-mark-container" href="/"><span
