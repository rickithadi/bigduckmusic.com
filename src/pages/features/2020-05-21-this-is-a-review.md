A recent resurgence of punk-powered feminism — or is that girl-powered punk? — raises the question: What was, or is, riot grrrl? A movement, a genre, an era, a scene?

The spelling itself is disputed: some OGs (original grrrls) argue two rs, others three; some just say girl. The term originated around 1991 almost as a joke, an offhand comment that got written into mimeographed fanzines that circulated among punk rock and feminist communities first in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast, then across the country, and eventually around the world. There was a decentralized but effective network of activist chapters that organized protests and performances, made art and zines, and also just sat around and talked — raising consciousness one girl at a time. And of course, there were recordings: handmade cassette tapes, small-label 45s, EPs, LPs and even CDs.

Politically, riot grrrl blasted feminism into the future: Centering the needs of a new generation via direct-action strategies, witty mantras and slogans such as “girl power” and “support girl love,” it became one of the most visible branches of what was dubbed third wave feminism. But materially the music was old-school, arguably the last blast of a predigital age. The mantra of the day was “do it yourself.” If you wrote a good song, you recorded it as quickly and cheaply as you could, then pressed it up and stuck it inside some cut-up-graphics-style paper sleeve. The songs were put out by regional labels like K, Kill Rock Stars, Chainsaw, Outpunk and Dischord. Some first saw the light of day on compilation albums like the “International Pop Underground Convention,” “Stars Kill Rock” and “Move Into Villa Villa Kula.”

No pledge or stamp made an act riot grrrl. The bands below generally contained members who identified as such, or performed at shows organized by local chapters, or sang about feminist issues over adamantly under-processed music from 1991 to 1996. Some were what the poet Tracie Morris calls “riot grrrl adjacent”: They existed before or formed simultaneously but separately from the activist centers. Before, beyond and beside riot grrrl there was an uprising of ferocious female acts playing music that was generally heavier and less overtly political: the Lunachicks, Frightwig, L7, Babes in Toyland, the Nymphs, Hole, the Gits. But that’s another list.

Leapt upon by the media, riot grrrl disappeared almost as quickly as it materialized — too stubborn or scared to plunge or get sucked into the mainstream. But its influence has persisted, resurfacing in the last decade with the traveling art exhibition[“Alien She,”](http://voxpopuligallery.org/project/alien-she-gallery-exhibition/)books including the young adult novel “Moxie” (optioned by Amy Poehler’s film company), and untold numbers of bands, most famously Pussy Riot. In the wake of this riot grrrl renaissance, or resurgence, the OGs are reclaiming their place in history, and their spot on the stage. In the past year,[Kill Rock Stars produced a podcast](https://www.killrockstars.com/news/new-podcast-miniseries-celebrates-25-years-of-bratmobile%27s-pottymouth)commemorating the 25th anniversary of Bratmobile’s debut album, “Pottymouth,” and two key groups — Bikini Kill and Team Dresch — have reunited for tours and are rereleasing albums. Bikini Kill played its first show in more than two decades on April 25; tickets sold out immediately for its limited tour.

This is a list of essential riot grrrl music, one song per artist — a starting point, not a totality. If you don’t like our list, make your own. That’s the point, really. Do it yourself. EVELYN McDONNELL

  Bikini Kill, Then and Now: A Front-Row View of a Punk Revolution

  MAY 3, 2019

#### 7 Year Bitch, ‘Dead Men Don’t Rape’ (1992)

The Seattle grunge band 7 Year Bitch was generally considered riot grrrl adjacent, but few tracks expressed the radical rage of the era better than this primal scream anthem condemning sexual assault. The vocalist Selene Vigil shouts each word of the title in ascending tones, as if she’s emphatically stating a point that should be obvious. E.M.

#### Autoclave, ‘Go Far’ (1991)

The Washington quartet Autoclave — not riot grrrls per se, but fellow travelers — was a decisive matrix for two of the city’s most creative musicians: the extraordinary guitarist Mary Timony (who would go on to Helium and Ex Hex, as well as a fruitful solo career) and the bassist Christina Billotte (who switched to guitar in Slant 6 and Quix\*o\*tic). The band’s self-titled compilation is a treasure trove of arrhythmic beats and elliptical lyrics, and its debut single, “Go Far,” showcases confident, understatedly sophisticated songwriting.

#### Bikini Kill, ‘Double Dare Ya’ (1992)

It starts with a declaration of war: “We’re Bikini Kill, and we want revolution girl-style now!” An audacious proposition follows: Be yourself. The first song on the first record by Bikini Kill established the bulwark for the battle to come. The guitarist Billy Karren’s squeals of feedback are like an amplified throat clearing, while Kathi Wilcox’s bass delivers marching orders. Kathleen Hanna speaks directly and intimately to a female audience — “Hey girlfriend!” — then Tobi Vail rapid-fires on the snare, and nothing would ever be the same.

“Rebel Girl,” from the same record, is known as the definitive riot grrrl anthem, the ultimate snapshot of the genre’s power-punk music and feminist heroism. But “Double Dare Ya” tossed the boys to the back of the room and pulled the girls to the front with its siren call. Hanna’s vocals are a marvel of emotional swagger, humor and rage as she speaks to adolescent hearts in the language they know: mocking the nagging of parents, the bullying of boyfriends and the patronizing of the patriarchy, then finally shouting the call to arms of daredevil friends: “You do have rights!” E.M.

#### Bratmobile, ‘Love Thing’ (1993)

The University of Oregon students Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman were an integral part of the riot grrrl origin story — their zine “Girl Germs” was a cut-and-paste feminist samizdat that first came out in early 1991. Naturally, a band followed, with Erin Smith, from Washington, joining on guitar. Unlike many of its peers, Bratmobile made records that almost matched its live shows’ intoxicating rush — its motto was just as much get up and fight as get up and dance. Wolfe favored old-fashioned cat’s-eye glasses and vaguely retro summer dresses, upending decades of expectations about women in rock bands: Here was someone who looked like a prim librarian spitting out acid-tongued harangues and taunts. On “Love Thing,” from the band’s debut album, “Pottymouth,” Neuman’s implacable, driving beat and the surfy lines Smith wrings from her vintage teardrop Kapa guitar keep pushing Wolfe’s sing-screaming. The lyrics have acquired a prescient, bitter resonance in the age of #MeToo, and yet the song pulses with the infectious rock ’n’ roll élan that characterized Bratmobile. E.V.

#### Cold Cold Hearts, ‘Any Resemblance …’ (1997)

After Bratmobile disbanded (temporarily, it would turn out), Wolfe and Smith formed Cold Cold Hearts with the Cutthroats bassist Nattles and the drummer Katherine Brown. Everything about that combo was bare-bones: its discography (one 7” and one album), its songs (under two minutes) and its production (minimal but poppy). But Cold Cold Hearts burned bright and was funny, too, fully indulging in the humor that marked Bratmobile’s best songs. Smith’s playing on “Any Resemblance…,” from the band’s self-titled LP, is a frantic hybrid of the B-52’s and the Cramps at warp speed. Wolfe’s line “Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental” may well poke fun at riot grrrl’s close-to-the-vest lyrics, or perhaps at the internecine battles that eventually drove wedges among bands, musicians and fans. E.V.

#### Emily’s Sassy Lime, ‘Mr. Moneybag$’ (1995)

The sisters Amy and Wendy Yao formed Emily’s Sassy Lime (it’s a palindrome) with their high school friend Emily Ryan in Southern California, legendarily after sneaking out of their houses to see Bratmobile and Bikini Kill. They played primitive shambolic pop in the spirit of the Shaggs and Shonen Knife. This song, from their debut album, “Desperate, Scared, But Social,” is a quintessential punk plaint against the Man. E.M.

Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17 in 1993.Pat Graham

#### Excuse 17, ‘Watchmaker’ (1995)

“Watchmaker” just may be a response to the press’s response to riot grrrl. “I want to rip off your best catchphrase/Smear your face across the music page,” Carrie Brownstein snarls over Becca Albee’s guitar and CJ Phillips’s drums on the band’s second and last album, “Such Friends Are Dangerous.” “Watchmaker” is at once clever (the chorus “I asked you what time it was/Not how to make a watch” remains an excellent riposte to mansplaining) and fierce — Brownstein lets rip the roar that Sleater-Kinney fans would come to know well. E.M.

#### Fifth Column, ‘Like This’ (1990)
