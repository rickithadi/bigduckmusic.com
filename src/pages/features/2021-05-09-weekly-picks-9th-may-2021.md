“We only have four days, I hope we make the most of it,” lewloh opens on Summer Boy. In one line, the singer-songwriter sets the heart-wrenching stakes of his stories – giving magnitude to microscopic moments, the singer-songwriter's latest ode tells an impressionistic story of collapsed relationships, framed through snapshots of vulnerability, non-communication and regret. Haunted by loss, the result is spellbindingly potent.

A far cry from the stark “Robots,” Summer Boy finds incredible poignancy in its rediscovered lushness, which provides a gorgeous backdrop that cushions his words' emotional weight. But most of all, unlike its predecessor, lewloh's latest suceeds because his words avoid contrived generalities. Here, all of his words feel rooted in something painfully intimate - as his verses reflect on failed communication and relationships, he elects for plain observations and diaristic takes on personal conflict: “You were my audience when I should have been listening / You raise your voice, I shut down,” he croons.

Electing for deliberate minimalism, Summer Boy's verses find vivid emotion at every turn. As his memories traverse through train rides through Michigan and recounts of conflicts, delicately recorded guitars follow his recollections, closely accompanying his vocals – coloured by subtle harmonies and double-tracked at every turn, it's a stylistic decision that gives his words a Sufjan-like levity. Think Carrie and Lowell: with his scenes of conflict uncomfortably evocative, every word feels like a punch to the gut.

But even with its ensuing pain, lewloh's aware that loss can be a helpless situation. People change, and situations are transient: "I don't mean to change you / I wish we weren't different," he muses. Eventually, he responds to the weight of loss with a resigned clarity, accepting the situation: “Summer boy / I never got to shine for you, I never made time for you,” he laments on a settled chorus. 

Devastatingly personal, it’s a haunting return to form for lewloh. A powerful portrait of regret, Summer Boy is arguably the best song he has ever made.

# Halal Sol

#### ***“Don't Feel The Bass”***

**Dijamin EP**

Be it on high-profile remixes (Charlie Lim’s Zero-Sum remix), or intuitive collaborations (Bongomann’s Deeperluv), Halal Sol’s immaculate live sets and brand of laid-back house grooves have established him as one of Singapore’s finest electronic producers. His debut single, Don’t Feel the Bass, sees him wielding his beats at his best, creating a deep house cruise that pulsates along with a propulsive energy.

The track’s first half is dedicated to buildup, a driving interplay between synths and drums that imbues the classic Halal Sol house sound with a refreshing kineticism – it goes extra hard. As the track progresses, Sol unleashes a flurry of arpeggiated synths and boisterous beats, balanced by embellishments that demonstrate a polished sense of restraint. By the track’s last quarter, all the track’s elements reach a rapturous culmination that feels truly earned. It’s the producer’s juggling between Don’t Feel The Bass’s elements that make it truly dynamic – a puppet master of the dancefloor, it’s exciting to think what’s in store for us on his upcoming debut EP, and even more so his live sets in a post-pandemic world.

# KHAi

#### ***“Jupiter*"**

![KHAi - Jupiter](https://res.cloudinary.com/ddomozydd/image/upload/v1620547184/khai_dems6f.jpg "KHAi - Jupiter")

Having seen him around since he was a busker on the streets, to playing small and big(ger) shows, KHAi’s latest offering, Jupiter, shows that he’s come a long way. 

The song is an uptempo jam full of sparkling beats and funky guitars, a departure from the songwriter’s heartfelt previous folk stylings. But the content seems to remain on romantic themes: "Like one of Jupiter's faithful moons / I wanna orbit all around you," he sings.

What I really enjoyed about Jupiter is the chorus’ chord progression – its rising nature giving it a subtle yet attention-grabbing kick, something that quickly caught my ear during my first listen. Although a common trick within the genre to spice up arrangements, it's a trick used well here, elevating the song from what could've been a stale result. 

That being said, KHAi has had better outings. Admittedly, his anthemic song Wanderlust is my favorite - and his vocal performance was probably the best on his previous single, Small Talk. On Jupiter, his vocal performance falls a little flat, its delivery a little lacking in emotion unlike the rest of his repertoire. But the quirky track seems to be show him trying something new – with its funky instrumentation at the forefront of the song, the track grooves along with an uplifting bounce that his music previously didn't have.

Like his previous discography, the track is well mixed too, which allows his new instrumental palette to shine alongside his delivery. His producer and mixing & mastering engineer seems to know his genre and him well – catering to his strengths as a vocalist, with his crooning pleasantly floating above the instrumentation. 

Although Jupiter isn't KHAi's greatest release – it seems to feel like a puzzle piece that fits perfectly in line with the artist he wants to portray to us - a versatile artist that's capable of more than his previous ballads and anthems. It may not match Wanderlust, but it's still a perfectly good song. Its light-hearted shape and content may be a little different than all the other pieces of the puzzle, but all of his songs form part of a bigger picture.
