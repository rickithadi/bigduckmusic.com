I attest to the following: I shall not give or receive aid during this exam. My answers will be entirely my own. Plagiarism software will scan my responses. My teacher will receive my responses.

If I give or receive help or submit work that is not my own: My score will be canceled. My attempt to cheat will be reported to college admissions offices and my high school. I will be banned from future College Board exams. Anyone who helps me or receives help from me will be investigated.

My grandfather picks up quartz and valuable onyx jewels. Send 60 dozen quart jars and 12 black pans.
