We were honoured to be have had the full band debut of Quite Quiet on the 14th of March! \
From the likes of funky scene veteran Time De Cotta and bedroom pop newcomers Cherry Syrup, we had  a wonderful all rounded lineup to mark this memorable occasion!

FEATURING SECRET ACT "MARSUPIALS"\
Under the guise of secret act "MARSUPIALS", Mars B surprised the crowd with an impeccable set featuring her signature sound that fuses folk, soul and trip-hop.
