June 1, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- I learned a few things while watching Tom
 Misch perform at the Tiny Desk that should've been obvious to a
longtime fan like me: He produces beats with a live audience in mind. As
 much as his drums slap, guitar is the foundation for most of his songs
and he showcases a burgeoning talent on the instrument throughout his
set.

I first caught wind of this UK wunderkind in 2014. Crafting his own
instrumental projects and remixing tracks by artists ranging from Busta
Rhymes to Lianne La Havas, Misch steadily garnered a dedicated following
 on SoundCloud. From there, he collaborated with other London artists
and released EPs of original music on the platform. Misch's style
doesn't revel in what's going on in pop music today; like a handful of
other artists from the UK, his interpretation of hip-hop and R&B is a
 continuation of what the greats who came before him started. A healthy
dose of that inspiration is drawn from the late J. Dilla, while Misch's
up-tempo dance numbers align him with the Kaytranadas of the world. In
2016, Misch — still just 21 years old at the time — decided to dabble
more in songwriting and explore that soothing timbre of his voice on
Reverie, and all of a sudden, his potential rose exponentially.

Misch and the band arrived bright and early to get situated behind the
Tiny Desk and rehearse. Misch has said before that he isn't a jazz
purist intrinsically, but the way he opens up a guitar solo or jams with
 saxophonist Braxton Cook, jazz music certainly runs through him.

If you haven't heard of Tom Misch before this performance, now's a good
time to catch up. Check out his breakthrough album, Geography, as well
as his earlier collaborations, then come back and watch his Tiny Desk
again for a true appreciation of his growth as an artist.
